  Welcome to SWarLogs

<p>
  Hello and welcome to <strong>SWarLogs.in</strong>. I was really inspired by tools, such as <%= link_to "SWARFARM", "http://swarfarm.com", target: "_blank" %>,
  <%= link_to "Rune Optimizer", "http://swrunes.all.my" %>, and some others. What I could not find, though, was a place to upload my logs for the dungeons runs.
  I wanted to know how well I was performing, how much faster I have become w.r.t. these dungeons in the last few months, what were the average drops I could expect, and so on.
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, I created this application to do exactly this. I log my runs using
  <%= link_to "SWProxy", "https://github.com/kakaroto/SWProxy" %>, and <%=
  link_to "this special plugin",
    "https://github.com/lstern/SWProxy-plugins/blob/master/plugins/RunLogger.py"
    %>. Your life will be so much easier, if you can learn how to use this Proxy.
</p>

  Go ahead and <%= link_to "register", new_user_registration_path %> or <%=
  link_to "log in", new_user_session_path %> to get started!

<h4>
  NOTE: This is very alpha release of this application. Please, take it with
  a pinch of salt!
